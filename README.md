## Why it's created

I wanted to try doing something bigger in Angular framework.

I like to sing along songs and spotify doesn't have a lyrics.

I've tried to implement that for them.

## Used resources

- [minilyrics proxy](https://github.com/olee/minilyrics-proxy). Used to get a lyrics from a MiniLyrics. Thanks for your work
- [angular spotify](https://github.com/trungk18/angular-spotify). You need to check that out. This was a big inspiration for my project
- [lcr parser](https://github.com/anhthii/lrc-parser). I've adopted this parser for a getting a lyrics in object form
